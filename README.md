This repository is the latest software development to help user's maintain and organize there files,folders,images,videos and data stored in on central place on there computer.
This repo version is perfect for persevering local folders for safekeeping as well as store multiple files and folders in just one location on.
"Ran out of space" or "Not enough storage for all your files ",no worries this repository addon helps configure bundels of large files and compresses the files into a small single archive folder.
For me the whole purpose for building this repo system is to help user control unnecessary folders and clear catche so user's wont panic about where to store folders whenever they run out of storage on there own computer.
Repository can be configured on a local machine for a single user, it is often stored on a server, which can be accessed by multiple users.
